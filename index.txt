## Overview

Chisel is a high-performance Markdown parser built in C++ that fully supports Obsidian-flavored Markdown. It was designed to handle complex syntax features, including links, callouts, math equations, and embedded content, while maintaining speed and efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Obsidian Syntax Support**: Implements full compatibility with Obsidian’s extended Markdown features, including wikilinks, callouts, and transclusions.
- **High-Performance Parsing**: Optimized parsing algorithms written in C++ to handle large Markdown files efficiently.
- **HTML & AST Output**: Converts Markdown into structured Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and HTML for rendering in different environments.
- **Custom Extension Support**: Allows adding new syntax rules and extensions to adapt to evolving Markdown needs.
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Provides detailed error messages and recovery mechanisms to handle malformed Markdown gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: For high-performance parsing and efficient memory management.
- **Flex & Bison (or Custom Lexer/Parser)**: For defining and processing Markdown grammar.
- **Obsidian Markdown Specification**: Ensures full compatibility with Obsidian's extended syntax.
- **Unicode & UTF-8 Handling**: Properly supports international characters and symbols.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was ensuring compatibility with all of Obsidian’s extended Markdown features while maintaining parsing speed. Handling nested elements like callouts, embedded content, and custom syntax required careful structuring of the parsing logic. Implementing a modular architecture allowed for future expansion and customization.

## Outcome

Chisel is now a fast, reliable Markdown parser tailored for Obsidian users. It provides a foundation for integrating Markdown rendering into custom applications while preserving full compatibility with Obsidian’s ecosystem. The project improves document processing efficiency and offers a flexible solution for developers working with Markdown at scale.

## Route Description

The trek began in Vitthalvadi Village, where we were greeted by the sight of Kothaligad Fort in the distance. The trail initially led us up a hillock offering panoramic views of Peth village. Moving westward, we entered the Baildara Trail, characterized by dense karvi shrubs and unmarked paths. The trail descended sharply to Kalakrai Village, where we paused for a short break.

From Kalakrai, the route transitioned to the Fenyadevi Ghat Trail, featuring steep ascents, dramatic rock formations, and ancient stone relics. The final stretch involved navigating narrow footpaths back to Vitthalvadi Village, concluding the trek.

---

## Trail Guide

### Starting Point: Vitthalvadi Village

1. Begin at Vitthalvadi village (may appear as Methalvadi on maps).
2. Cross a small hillock to reach the start of the Baildara trail.
3. From the hillock, Kothaligad and its base village Peth can be sighted.

### Baildara Trail (to Kalakrai)

1. Follow the Baildara trail, which is narrow and overgrown with karvi.
2. Descend from 700m to 450m to reach a four-way junction.
3. Turn left (westward) to continue towards Kalakrai village.
   - _(Do not take the straight-down path to a small village in Raigad district.)_
   - _(Turn right to visit an old well.)_

### Kalakrai to Vitthalvadi via Fenyadevi Ghat

1. From Kalakrai, head westward along the Fenyadevi ghat trail.
2. The trail eventually makes a sharp southward turn. Look for a stone relic under a tree at this point.
3. Continue to the Fenyadevi ghat, which is wide and rocky.
4. Look for another holy relic carved in stone along the way.
5. Climb 200m to reach the flatland at the top of the ghat.
6. From the flatland, follow the footpath to return to Vitthalvadi village.
