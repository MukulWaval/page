## Route Description

The trek began in Vitthalvadi Village, where we were greeted by the sight of Kothaligad Fort in the distance. The trail initially led us up a hillock offering panoramic views of Peth village. Moving westward, we entered the Baildara Trail, characterized by dense karvi shrubs and unmarked paths. The trail descended sharply to Kalakrai Village, where we paused for a short break.

From Kalakrai, the route transitioned to the Fenyadevi Ghat Trail, featuring steep ascents, dramatic rock formations, and ancient stone relics. The final stretch involved navigating narrow footpaths back to Vitthalvadi Village, concluding the trek.

## Trail Guide

### Starting Point: Vitthalvadi Village

1. Begin at Vitthalvadi village (may appear as Methalvadi on maps).
2. Cross a small hillock to reach the start of the Baildara trail.
3. From the hillock, Kothaligad and its base village Peth can be sighted.

### Baildara Trail (to Kalakrai)

1. Follow the Baildara trail, which is narrow and overgrown with karvi.
2. Descend from 700m to 450m to reach a four-way junction.
3. Turn left (westward) to continue towards Kalakrai village.
   - _(Do not take the straight-down path to a small village in Raigad district.)_
   - _(Turn right to visit an old well.)_

### Kalakrai to Vitthalvadi via Fenyadevi Ghat

1. From Kalakrai, head westward along the Fenyadevi ghat trail.
2. The trail eventually makes a sharp southward turn. Look for a stone relic under a tree at this point.
